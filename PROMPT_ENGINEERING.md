# Prompt Engineering Documentation

This document explains how prompts are constructed and used in the application, including story, character, and background prompts. Example outputs and iterations are provided for clarity.

## 1. How the Story Prompt Works

The story prompt is designed to generate a narrative based on user input or predefined settings. It typically includes:
- A setting or scenario
- Main characters
- Desired tone or style
- Specific actions or events

**Example Construction:**
```
"Write a short story set in a magical forest. The main character is a brave fox named Luna. The story should be adventurous and suitable for children. Luna discovers a hidden path and meets a wise owl."
```

The prompt guides the model to produce a coherent, engaging story matching the requirements.

## 2. How Character and Background Prompts Are Constructed

### Character Prompts
Character prompts describe the appearance, personality, and role of a character. They include:
- Name and species
- Physical traits (color, size, distinguishing features)
- Personality traits
- Role in the story

**Example Construction:**
```
"Describe Luna, a fox with bright orange fur, a bushy tail, and curious green eyes. Luna is brave, clever, and always eager to help others."
```

### Background Prompts
Background prompts set the scene for the story or image. They include:
- Location
- Time of day
- Atmosphere
- Key visual elements

**Example Construction:**
```
"Create a background of a magical forest at dawn, with tall ancient trees, glowing mushrooms, and soft mist covering the ground."
```

## 3. Example Outputs and Iterations

### Example Output (Story)
```
Luna the fox woke up early in the magical forest. As she explored, she found a hidden path lined with glowing mushrooms. Following it, she met a wise owl who shared secrets of the forest. Together, they discovered a sparkling stream and made new friends along the way.
```

### Example Output (Character)
```
Luna is a small fox with bright orange fur and a bushy tail. Her curious green eyes sparkle with intelligence. She is known for her bravery and cleverness, always ready to help those in need.
```

### Example Output (Background)
```
The magical forest is bathed in the soft light of dawn. Tall trees stretch towards the sky, their leaves shimmering with dew. Glowing mushrooms dot the forest floor, and a gentle mist weaves between the trunks, creating an enchanting atmosphere.
```

### Iterations
Prompts can be refined based on output quality:
- **Initial Prompt:** "Write a story about Luna the fox in a forest."
- **Refined Prompt:** "Write an adventurous story about Luna, a brave fox, exploring a magical forest and meeting a wise owl."
- **Further Iteration:** "Write a story for children about Luna, a clever fox, who discovers a hidden path in a magical forest and learns an important lesson from a wise owl."

Each iteration adds detail and guidance, improving the relevance and quality of the output.

For further customization, adjust prompts to include more specific traits, settings, or desired outcomes.
